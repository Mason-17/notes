# Variables

When declaring variables, there are two primary kinds:
    - mutable (can change)

    - immutable (cannot change, similar to a constant)

Mutable variables can be declared like so:
```
var <variable> = <value>
OR
var <variable>: <type>
OR
var <variable>: <type> = <value>
```
Or as a block:
```
var
    <variable> = <value>
    <variable> = <value>
```
